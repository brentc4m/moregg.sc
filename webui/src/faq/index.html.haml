%h3 What is it?
%p
  More GG lets you find others to play Starcraft 2 custom games with.
  It takes into account your league and race and lets you filter opponents
  by their league and race. You can also select specific maps to play on
  and whether you want to play a single game or a series (best of 3, etc).
%h3 How does it work?
%p
  When you first start you will be asked for your profile URL and race.
  After logging in you can change the game options to your preference and
  find a game.
%p
  When an opponent is found they will join your lobby and the game settings
  will be displayed in chat. A randomly generated chat room name will also
  be displayed. Join this chat channel on Battle.net and host the game.
